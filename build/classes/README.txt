User Information:

To use the Truck Builder, double-click the attached TruckBuilder.jar file.
Enter your name in the text box at the top, then proceed to provide your choices
for customizations for your truck. You must provide a cab style, a bed style,
an engine, and a color. You are able to add optional features as follows: four
wheel drive, running boards, alloy wheels, all-terrain suspension. When you have
finished your selections, click the "Build" button at the bottom left corner of
the screen to send in your customization requests and print your invoice,
including requested customizations, subtotal, extra fees, and grand total.
Upon clicking "OK", you are returned to the ordering screen with everything
blank to allow for another order. Click "Start Over" at any point to clear all
selections and your name to begin a new order. Click "Exit" at any point to exit
the program.

Developer information:

This program was written in Java. The program is run by double-clicking the
attached TruckBuilder.jar file. The program accepts typing in the name text box,
and otherwise only clicks for the radio buttons and check boxes. Any possible
errors are handled and replaced with intentional pop-up boxes to inform the user
of a mistake they have made in operating the program.

-----------------------------

1. What programming language did you use and why?
I used Java to write this program because I have over a year of formal education
in the language, and I am the most experienced and the most comfortable using
Java.

-----------------------------

2. Given that you had a short amount of time to design and develop this program,
answer the following questions:

a. How could you improve your program's interface?
I could have improved my program's interface by possibly resizing the window and
laying out the inputs in a different layout to be a bit nicer to look at while
using.

-----------------------------

b. (Proficiency question)
While I believe my proficiency was on par with what this program required of me,
I also believe that writing this program has improved my proficiency with
programming certain kinds of logic and UI elements.

-----------------------------

c. How could you have improved your program's efficiency?
I could have improved my program's efficiency by possibly defining and accessing
the prices of each customization request in a different way than altering the
base price directly with ItemListeners on the appropriate radio buttons and
check boxes. This also could have made that part of the code easier to follow
while reading.

3. If you didn't use object oriented programming, how could you have
incorporated it into your program? If you did use object oriented programming,
how could you have written this program without it?
